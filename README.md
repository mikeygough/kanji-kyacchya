# kanji-kyacchya
kanji-kyacchya is a pygame built to help japanese language learners better distinguish similar kanji.

one aspect that makes learning kanji so difficult is how similar they can be!

take, for instance, __å­˜__ & __åœ¨__. they just barely differ and in this instance the two actually have the same meaning (exist).

in kanji-kyacchya, a goal kanji is presented to the user and they must catch that kanji while
avoiding the visually similar alternative (and the demons ðŸ‘¹).

to play kanji-kyacchya, clone this repo and install the requirements:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

then, once inside the repo run the game with:

```python3 main.py```

kanji-kyacchya has two modes: easy & difficult!

to switch between easy and difficult mode simply uncomment the mode you prefer in the constants.py file.

### Reflections...

* currently game instantiation is manual. a data.json file contains all game kanji. this is updated manually as are the images which represent a kanji. in the future i'd love to incorporate an image generator library (loop through data, if image doesn't exist generate both easy and difficult mode images)

* while distinguishing is important for understanding kanji it's also important to know readings & meanings. a mode which prompts users for the readings / meanings could aid in retention.

* a wani-kani plugin that gets each users unique 'leeches' could be a hit with the wk community.

### Reference:

#### virtual environments
Create a Python3 Virtual Environment: 
```python3 -m venv env```

Activate the Virtual Environment:
```source env/bin/activate```

Deactivate the Virtual Environment:
```deactivate```

To Remove a Virtual Environment:
```sudo em -rf venv```

#### requirements.txt
Automagically create a requirements.txt file:
```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```
